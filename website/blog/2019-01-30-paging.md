Paging is one of the common problems that you face in the backend no matter if you are using REST or GraphQL. With relayjs Facebook introduced a few server specifications that introduced a way to elegantly to paging.

<!--truncate-->

With the upcomming version 0.7.0 of Hot Chocolate we are introducing support for the [**relay cursor connections specification**](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm). We have implemented a field middleware that handles basically the whole paging logic for you when you are using `IQueryable` or `IEnumerable`.

So, lets have a look at an example with a mongo database. Before we can start let`s create a mini server project with our dotnet cli template.

If you do not have the template installed do so by executing the following command:

```bash
dotnet new -i HotChocolate.Templates.Server
```

Next, let`s create a server:

```bash
mkdir paging
cd paging
dotnet new graphql-server
```

Open the project in your editor of choice and upgrade the Hot Chocolate packages to the latest preview of version 0.7.0.
